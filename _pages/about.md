Since my graduation from Chalmer University of Technology in August 2017, I have been working in 5G Radio Access Network(RAN) development at Ericsson AB, firstly as software developer then as system developer which is also my current role. My main responsibility is to perform early phase study of new wireless system feature, develope 5G wireless system prototypes, formulate network performance requirements and drive product development.
C/C++ and Python are mostly used programming languages or daily working languages.
I speak Mandarin, English and some basic Swedish.
